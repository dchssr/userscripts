Userscripts
===========

Some days, a guy just needs to make the Web a little more tolerable.
I'd recommend using [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) these days.

[![Install ca-carpalx](https://img.shields.io/badge/install-6b8e23)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dchssr/userscripts/main/ca-carpalx.user.js)

This is just a userscript that adds [Carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization)'s
optimized layouts to [colemak.academy](https://www.colemak.academy/).

### Why?

It's not every day I get a whiff of inspiration _and_ keep sniffing it
long enough to crank something out of it.
Besides, it's probably time I tinker with other layouts and it'd be easier
with a typing tutor.
